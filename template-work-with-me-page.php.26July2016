						having freedom with your time and living authentically doing work you enjoy.

								      			I am so grateful for the teachings and experience I had. Before working with you I was paralyzed with fear around money. I was able to bring money into my life but managing it was so scary. At first I didn’t really think I would hear any new advice, I knew I needed help but part of me thought I was a lost cause. After going through your program I now have a new relationship with money on both the spiritual and practical levels. I can see that it is possible to evolve in a deep way and I see how powerful this work is in influencing all areas of my life, with my health, relationship, business, and peace of mind. It is truly a spiritual path for me and I look forward to building wealth that will give me the freedom to serve in a big way. THANK YOU for gently helping me heal this and getting me to a place I never thought I could reach… What a gift!!!

								      		Before I knew Leisa Peterson, I understood that money and energy were connected	that money is energy and abundance is energy. Now that I have experienced Leisa’s work, I feel how this relationship is causal of the money and abundance that I receive and create. Leisa’s uncanny ability to delve deep into the heart of the money matter has allowed me to ask key questions that I never would have thought of asking, and to discover solutions beyond my wildest dreams! I feel the shift! Meditation + Action = ABUNDANCE! Thank You!

								      		Leisa Peterson has done amazing things for my life and my happiness.
											She not only has assisted in giving me the foundation to create wealth and abundance in my career, but she has also provided me with the tools, knowledge and mindfulness to experience life in a peaceful, flowing and joyous way. It is almost impossible to articulate the incredible impact of Leisa’s guidance in a few short sentences. The manner in which we approach each day, each choice, each situation, each person, each belief, our money and ourselves can be shifted to produce magnificent results. I have been a part of her Power Up Your Wealth and Wealth Group Programs as well as her Mindful Wealth Mastery private coaching. Each program provided the gateway to a new and everlasting approach to lead a fully abundant life.
											Sincere and loving thanks.
