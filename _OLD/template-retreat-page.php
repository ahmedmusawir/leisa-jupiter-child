					One of the best things I found in working with Leisa Peterson is the attention given to beliefs around money. Those (hidden) beliefs effect my everyday life, and with this new awareness, I feel well-armed against unconscious, limiting beliefs. With Leisa’s guidance and mindfulness direction, I feel like my new, successful relationship with money has totally opened up. Beliefs of all kinds can create openings or blocks; money is no different. I’m so excited to see some of my most strongly-held money beliefs be knocked down, creating a new opening for abundance.

				I’m an empath, money coach, life coach for entrepreneurs, best-selling author, podcaster & blogger.  I’m known for my ability to quickly identify the exact issues that are holding you back from achieving your true potential.  Especially when it comes to money and wealth creation.  I draw upon various modalities including shadow work, Emotional Freedom Technique, Allowing ™, mindfulness practices and breath work to assist you in clearing out the emotional and mental obstacles that are holding you back.  Then I provide customized instructions that show you exactly how you can apply these breakthrough experiences in your life and business.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result of my courses, coachings and teachings I get to help thousands of people develop tools & skills for attracting greater wealth, freedom & peace of mind into their lives.  It is truly my life’s passion to help others in this way.  I’m also the founder of wealthclinic.com, I’m a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER ™ , have my MBA  in finance and spent over two decades in financial services.

				I did my best to avoid embracing my profound empathic abilities until several back-to-back tragedies shook me to the core and led me to begin a journey into the big, philosophical questions we’ve been struggling with for millennia.  Questions like, “Why are we here?”  “Do we ever really die?”  “What is happiness?”  This search led to exploring the world’s religions and working with many different teachers over the course of 17 years.  I studied Buddhism, Contemplative Christianity, Sufism, Hinduism, the Tao, Self-Enquiry and more.  In addition to discovering the truths that exist beyond the physical world and any one religion, I began to harness the incredible powers that arise when we tap into our intuitive connection with Source.  Power that’s available to all of us.  I love that I’m still learning every day.  It’s such an awesome and exciting journey to be on.
