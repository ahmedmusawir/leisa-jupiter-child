			<blockquote>
				<h2>
					One of the best things I found in working with Leisa Peterson is the attention given to beliefs around money. Those (hidden) beliefs effect my everyday life, and with this new awareness, I feel well-armed against unconscious, limiting beliefs. With Leisa’s guidance and mindfulness direction, I feel like my new, successful relationship with money has totally opened up. Beliefs of all kinds can create openings or blocks; money is no different. I’m so excited to see some of my most strongly-held money beliefs be knocked down, creating a new opening for abundance.

				Leisa Peterson is an empath, money coach, life coach to entrepreneurs, author, podcaster and blogger.

Once discovered Leisa draws upon various modalities, including shadow work, Emotional Freedom Technique, Allowing™, mindfulness practices, and breath work to assist her clients in clearing out these emotional and mental obstacles.  Leisa can then provide customized instructions for how to apply these breakthrough experiences into one’s practical life and business.
			</p>

				As a result of her courses, coaching and teachings, Leisa is helping thousands of people develop tools and skills for attracting greater wealth, freedom and peace of mind into their lives.

			<p>
				Leisa did her best to avoid embracing her profound empathic abilities until several back-to-back tragedies led her to begin a journey to find the answers to questions like, “Why are we here?”, “Do we ever really die?”, “What is happiness?” This search led to exploring the world’s religions and working with many different teachers over the course of 17 years including Buddhism, Contemplative Christianity, Sufism, Hinduism,  the Tao, Self-Enquiry and more.  In addition to discovering the truths that exist beyond the physical world and any one religion, Leisa began to harness the incredible powers that arise when we tap into our intuitive connection with Source.  Leisa uses her intuitive abilities and familiarity of money challenges to help people break free of lack and scarcity patterns so they can fully step into their natural states of prosperity, joy and freedom.
