						I help high achieving, heart centered entrepreneurs just like you committed to creating profitable & thriving 
						businesses.  My greatest joy is helping you break through the blocks that keep you from getting more of what 
						you want, including more joy, time & freedom.  After barely coming up for air while earning my first million I 
						learned that true success is measured in more than money - it also includes having freedom with your time 
						(ie not being a slave to the thing you’ve created) choosing work that gives purpose, joy and allows you to be 
						the best version of yourself.

						We’ll go wherever we need to go in our sessions, whether that’s addressing a time-management issue (so you can actually step 
						away from the computer screen) a real-time struggle (because every entrepreneur knows things pop up unexpectedly) or work 
						through a new long-term vision (you have to disengage from the grind long enough to see the path ahead).
						<br><br>
						My goal is two-fold.  To start I will guide you through a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of your business to uncover what’s 
						working, what isn’t and what possibilities exist to elevate your purpose and profits.  Second, I show you how to lead from context, 
						which means listening to your inner voice, the people on your team and the information around you.  You’ll have unlimited email access 
						to me so we can work on real-time decision-making skills and your journey will always be supported.

								      			I am so grateful for the teachings and experience I had. Before working with you I was paralyzed with fear around money. I was able to bring money into my life but managing it was so scary. At first I didn’t really think I would hear any new advice, I knew I needed help but part of me thought I was a lost cause. After going through your program I now have a new relationship with money on both the spiritual and practical levels. I can see that it is possible to evolve in a deep way and I see how powerful this work is in influencing all areas of my life, with my health, relationship, business, and peace of mind. It is truly a spiritual path for me and I look forward to building wealth that will give me the freedom to serve in a big way. THANK YOU for gently helping me heal this and getting me to a place I never thought I could reach… What a gift!!!

								      		Before I knew Leisa Peterson, I understood that money and energy were connected	that money is energy and abundance is energy. Now that I have experienced Leisa’s work, I feel how this relationship is causal of the money and abundance that I receive and create. Leisa’s uncanny ability to delve deep into the heart of the money matter has allowed me to ask key questions that I never would have thought of asking, and to discover solutions beyond my wildest dreams! I feel the shift! Meditation + Action = ABUNDANCE! Thank You!

											She not only has assisted in giving me the foundation to create wealth and abundance in my career, but she has also provided me with the tools, knowledge and mindfulness to experience life in a peaceful, flowing and joyous way. It is almost impossible to articulate the incredible impact of Leisa’s guidance in a few short sentences. The manner in which we approach each day, each choice, each situation, each person, each belief, our money and ourselves can be shifted to produce magnificent results. I have been a part of her Power Up Your Wealth and Wealth Group Programs as well as her Mindful Wealth Mastery private coaching. Each program provided the gateway to a new and everlasting approach to lead a fully abundant life.
											Sincere and loving thanks.
